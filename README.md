 # Krunker_FasterQuickSell
A faster quick sell option for krunker

# **Requirements**
Tampermonkey Chrome Extension 
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

# **Installation**
1. Install Tampermonkey
2. Click on the extention
3. Click "Create new script..."
4. 'Ctrl-A' then 'Backspace'
5. Copy the code from "quickSell.js"
6. Paste in Tampermonkey and change the "Excluded Items" to whatever you want to exclude
7. 'Ctrl-S'

# **Usage**
1. Run the script by pressing 'Shift+2' or '@' in Krunker Market
    - url: https://krunker.io/social.html?p=market
2. The green items will NOT be quick sold. These are items you excluded in the quickSell.js file
    - These items can only be sold by editing the "Excluded Items" in the .js file 
3. Items can also be excluded/included by hovering over them and clicking "Exclude" / "Include"
    - You will have to do this every time so if there are items you know you'll never quick sell then exclude them from the quickSell.js file
